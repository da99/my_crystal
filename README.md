======

* SHARDS\_INSTALL\_PATH must be an absolute path: $PWD/my/dir
  because the value is used outside of target directory.

* cat diff | grep -v -i -P "vlc|webkit|xdg|xdm|xorg|lossless|screen|thunar|XFCE|gnome|mate|volume|vorbi|usb|totem|sound|qt5|cutter|python|ruby|lightdm|cinnam" >/tmp/crystal
